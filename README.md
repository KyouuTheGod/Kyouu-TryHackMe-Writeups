# TryHackMe Writeups

This repository contains my personal notes and writeups from TryHackMe rooms.
The goal is to document my learning process in penetration testing, focusing on:

- Enumeration methodology
- Web application vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation
- Reporting and remediation

⚠️ Educational purpose only. No real systems were harmed.
